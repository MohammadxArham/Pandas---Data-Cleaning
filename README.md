# Data Cleaning with Pandas  

## Overview  
This project focuses on cleaning a raw Excel data file using Python's Pandas library. The primary goal was to address common data quality issues such as handling missing values, standardizing formatting, and preparing the dataset for further analysis.  

## Key Features  
- Addressed missing values (nulls) by applying appropriate imputation or removal techniques.  
- Removed leading/trailing spaces in textual data to ensure uniformity.  
- Standardized capitalization for consistency in text fields.  
- Fixed formatting issues such as concatenated words by introducing proper separators or spacing.  

## Steps Performed  
1. **Loading the Data:**  
   - Imported the raw Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame for cleaning.  

2. **Handling Null Values:**  
   - Identified missing values using `.isnull()` and filled or dropped them depending on the context.  
     - **Numeric columns:** Imputed with mean/median values where feasible.  
     - **Categorical columns:** Filled with appropriate placeholders or dropped rows with excessive nulls.  

3. **Removing Spaces:**  
   - Trimmed unwanted spaces in column headers and string data using `.strip()` and `.str.replace()`.  

4. **Standardizing Text:**  
   - Converted all text data to lowercase using `.str.lower()` for uniformity.  

5. **Fixing Joined Words:**  
   - Identified concatenated words in relevant columns and split them appropriately.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Pandas library  

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies if required.  
2. Load the raw Excel file into the script.  
3. Execute the script to output a clean DataFrame or save it as a new Excel file.  

## Future Improvements  
- Automate the cleaning process for similar datasets using functions or pipelines.  
- Include exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify additional inconsistencies.  

Feel free to customize based on specific techniques or nuances in your cleaning process!
